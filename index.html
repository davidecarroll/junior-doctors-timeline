            <p>After some progress and after developing a basic framework of what a contract could look like, talks stalled as the government wanted to remove key safeguards for trainees such as protections on safe working hours at the expense of patient safety and sustainable working patterns for doctors. </p>
            <p>Kitty Mohan, co-chair of the junior doctors’ committee at the time said the contract proposals lack a “fundamental grasp” of the way in which NHS staff work and that doctors are “upset and frustrated” with how their work was not being “valued, noticed and recognised.”</p>

            <p>The DDRB report says that the current contract is no longer fit for purpose and is hindering the achievement of the NHS’s goals to improve patient care and outcomes, and is unaffordable in the current financial climate. The report includes several recommendations that upset junior doctors (box 1). NHS Employers in England agreed that the DDRB report should be the basis for finalising new contractual arrangements. NHS Scotland, and Wales reject the new contract and decide not to enforce it.</p>

        <p>"I am writing to register my concern about the way in which you have publicly misrepresented an academic article published in The BMJ. </br> </br> The article, by Freemantle et al, reports an analysis of 30 day mortality after admission to
          hospital and finds a statistical excess of deaths in patients admitted at weekends. What it
          does not do is apportion any cause for that excess, nor does it take a view on what
          proportion of those deaths might be avoidable. Despite the authors’ very clear statements
          to this effect in the paper and elsewhere, you have repeatedly told MPs and the public via
          media interviews that these deaths are due to poor staffing at weekends, with a particular
          emphasis on medical staffing. This clearly implies that you believe these excess deaths are
          avoidable.</br></br>
          I ask you to publicly clarify the statements you have made in relation to this article to show
          that you fully understand the issues involved. We all want the very best health service for
          patients and the public. Misusing data to mislead the public is not the way to achieve this."</p>

          <p>Junior doctors have today overwhelmingly voted in favour of taking industrial action after the government’s threat to impose a new junior doctor contract in England from August next year.

            Following a ballot of more than 37,000 junior doctors in England, more than 99 per cent have voted in favour of industrial action short of a strike, and 98 per cent for full strike action, demonstrating the strength of feeling amongst the profession. The BMA announced the dates of one day of industrial action and two days of industrial actions in advance so that junior doctors and their employers could make arrangements to cover the withdrawal of their services.</p>

            <p>In a move that drew criticism from the medical profession, the medical director of the NHS in England asked for assurances that junior doctors will be on-hand to help in the event of a terror attack during planned strike action next month.</p>
            <p>This provoked fury among junior doctors and prompted the chair of medical regulator the General Medical Council to declare “the entire profession” would “respond immediately” in such an event.</p>

              <p>But this assertion was later questioned by academics. Emails show one of the authors of the unpublished paper, which Mr Hunt was using to justify the 6,000 figure, was unhappy with how his study was being used. A spokesman said the information had been shared with the department by the NHS's medical director for England, Sir Bruce Keogh. Labour is calling for an investigation into whether Mr Hunt leaned on his department in order to cover up his advance sight of the study.</p>

                <p>Junior doctors from NHS hospitals came in to London’s Limehouse Town Hall to show eighteen kids on their half-term break just what it takes to keep the world’s best health service running - despite attacks by the government on the efficiency and sustainability of the NHS. After a day of learning how to suture, bandage, plaster and carry out minor operations, they wrote letters to the Secretary of State for Health, Jeremy Hunt, asking him to reconsider the Conservative government’s new contracts for junior doctors.
                  <p>They later went on a field trip to the Department of Health where they were barred from entering.</p>
                  <p>They also called Jeremy Hunt a ‘shrimp’.</p>
